- it seems suspicious that there's hard-coded string for player-name
  - either there's code smell, you could give any string to the won method, maybe ENUM or match exact names so we don't run into invalid names
  - so it doesn't treat player 1 as player 2.
  - open/closed mustache for curly braches
  - keep the flow of the conversation and even though we don't stick to 5 mins timer. It's nice to get the idea to the logical end point.
  - intellj is nice and be able to use refactoring
    - there's couple one we had to do little more manual, certainly better than emacs.
  - intellij is like power tools that hasn't been utilized
  - why do we worry about files even? I care about class, traits and how they're related and organized.
    - should be thinking about packages, classes
    - in java, sometimes more boiler plate to create different files.
